Pub/sub - REST producers
========================

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Having been
:doc:`assigned to a topic <../admin/producer>`,
REST producers use plain HTTP verbs to publish messages that are routed to queues of consumers subscribed to the topic.

All the examples below assume that there is a */customer/created* topic and the producer used is called *CRM* with its
HTTP Basic Auth username/password being *crm/pwd*, as in the screenshots below.
