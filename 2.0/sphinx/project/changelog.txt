* Startup scripts to start Zato environments when an OS starts

* Framework for API testing (https://github.com/zatosource/zato-apitest)

* Ability to output HTML in services using Django templates

* Logging configuration migrated to YAML

* Ability to hot-deploy code directly from a repository checkout (i.e. from GitHub)

* Improved logging * components have their own log files

* Apache-like HTTP access log for servers, compatible with popular log parsing tools

* Ability for users to store config in their own ini-like files

* zato --version is clearer what exact git commit was used to build it

* Constants in `zato.common.broker_message <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/master/code/zato-common/src/zato/common/broker_message.py>`_
  became wrappers around integers - use *.value* attribute to reference them. For instance, SERVICE.PUBLISH.value instead of SERVICE.PUBLISH.

* Added a :ref:`hot_deploy.delete_after_pick_up <admin-guide-config-server-hot_deploy.delete_after_pick_up>` flag,
  setting of which to False will prevent Zato from deleting hot-deployed Python code effectively
  making servers work in a live-reload mode

  :doc:`underlying API <../public-api/details/zato.security.basic-auth.change-password>`

  :doc:`HTTP <../web-admin/outgoing/plain-http>`/:doc:`SOAP <../web-admin/outgoing/soap>`
  connection's pool size  (this is a per-worker setting)

* Made :ref:`Service.log_input <progguide-write-service-log_input>`/:ref:`output <progguide-write-service-log_output>` 
  log the user_msg as a prefix of the dictionary of data to write out, not as part
  of its keys


1.1 - 2013-06-02
================

* Unified :doc:`installer <../admin/guide/install-zato>` for Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora and OS X
* Added the :doc:`zato check-config <../admin/cli/check-config>` command
* Fixed a bug which lead to double execution of user-defined scheduler jobs
* Made quickstart clusters more robust when confronted with improperly configured servers,
  sanity checks are now performed before servers are started
* Changed the default value of :ref:`main.deployment_lock_expires <admin-guide-config-server-main.deployment_lock_expires>`
  so it works on 32-bit systems without a need for reconfiguring servers after they're
  created
* Made scripts generated by :doc:`zato quickstart <../admin/cli/quickstart>` relocatable
* Newly created servers start CPU_COUNT 
  `gunicorn <http://gunicorn.org>`_
  :ref:`workers <admin-guide-config-server-main.gunicorn_workers>`
  by default now, not CPU_COUNT * 2 as previously
* HAProxy load-balancer can now bind to all interfaces. Patch provided by 
  `Myroslav Opyr <http://talk.quintagroup.com/blogs/myroslav>`_
