BST - Authoring definitions
===========================

Overview
--------

:doc:`BST <./index>` definitions list transitions between states a given business objects goes through during its lifetime.
For instance, an order from a customer will have at least several clearly defined states it needs to pass before the process is complete.

A BST definition may have multiple entry and end points. A state may transition onto itself. Each definition may contain a list
of states that interrupt a given process forcibly, such as Canceled or Rejected indicating a business condition under which
the process for the business object should be stopped.

Each definition is a text file with a series of entries in plain English, such as:

::

    Orders
    ------

    Objects: Order, Priority order
    New: Submitted
    Submitted: Ready
    Ready: Sent
    Sent: Confirmed, Rejected
    Rejected: Updated
    Updated: Ready
    Force stop: Canceled, Timed out

Such files, no matter their extension which may be .txt, are placed in a Zato server's *config/repo/proc/bst* directory out of which
they are picked up when the server is starting. The same definitions files need to be used across all the servers in a single Zato
cluster.

Each definition is in its own file. Likewise, each version of the same definition must be in its own file.

What definitions are composed of
--------------------------------

Names
~~~~~

Each definition starts with its name followed by one or more dashes to indicate that what follows next is the actual body
of the definition. To improve clarity an empty line may be added after the dashes.

Example names:

::

  Feasibility study
  -----------------

::

  Open account
  ------------

Objects
~~~~~~~

BST definitions must list what business objects they are concerned with. An object is an arbitrary textual label attached to a
definition in the *Objects:* line. The same object may be used in multiple definitions or different version of the same
definition. A single definition may list more than one object.

One object in the definition:

::

  Feasibility study
  -----------------

  Objects: Landline

Two objects in the definition:

::

  Feasibility study
  -----------------

  Objects: Landline, Gigabit

States and transitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

States are listed after the definition's name. Each state points to one ore more further states one is allowed to move
a business object to.

Each state is defined by the virtue of its being first time used as either a source or one of target states in a transition.
It's not mandatory to declare states upfront before they are used.

If no state points to a given state, the latter is considered one of start states in the definition. Conversely,
if a state doesn't lead to at least state it is considered an end state, possibly one of many end states in the definition.
