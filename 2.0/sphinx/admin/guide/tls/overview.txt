SSL/TLS
=======

Zato supports SSL/TLS out of the box, including client certificates, and offers means for configuring HTTP channels to allow
requests in basing on individual fields of certificates provided by client applications.

Encrypted traffic from external applications to a Zato cluster is terminated at the load-balancer and connections
from the load-balancer to servers and back may optionally use a separate encrypted link.

It's also possible for user services to transparently access SSL/TLS-protected resources, including ones secured with
client certificates.
