SSL/TLS traffic from client applications
========================================

Key features:

* Client applications may invoke services using SSL/TLS
* Services can be also optionally secured with client certificates
* Traffic to a Zato cluster is always terminated at the cluster's load-balancer which may 
  :doc:`optionally re-encrypt <lb-servers>` it using its own crypto material while communicating with servers it fronts for
* Load-balancer passes SSL/TLS-related information to servers as set of custom HTTP headers that are always available to services
  through their :ref:`self.wsgi_environ <progguide-write-service-wsgi_environ>` dictionary


Tasks
-----

* Configuring a cluster to accept SSL/TLS connections without client certificates
* Configuring a cluster to require SSL/TLS client certificates
* Configuring channels to require specific fields in client certificates
