SOAP examples
==============

Create a :doc:`SOAP channel<../../web-admin/channels/plain-http>` to  turn on
automatic (de-)serialization of incoming/returned SOAP messages. You deal with the SOAP
body only, headers are dealt with by Zato itself.

As with :doc:`XML<./xml>`, the examples below use `lxml <http://lxml.de>`_ because it's
a very good choice for efficient XML processing but you're not constrained to that one library
only.

lxml offers every feature you need for working XML, such as namespaces, XPath,
XSLT, XInclude, XML Schema, RelaxNG and many more but if you prefer other tools
you can use anything and Zato won't constrain you.

Accessing SOAP request
----------------------

The SOAP body converted to an `ObjectifiedElement <http://lxml.de/objectify.html>`_ 
is available as self.request.payload. As with any other channels, the raw request
is available as self.request.raw_request should you need to access SOAP headers
manually.
