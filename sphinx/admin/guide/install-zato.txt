Installing Zato binaries
========================

Overview
--------

In its current version of |version|, Zato can be installed in one of the following systems:

* `Ubuntu Linux 12.04 LTS <http://www.ubuntu.com/>`_
* `Linux Mint 13 LTS <http://www.linuxmint.com/index.php>`_

There is nothing Linux-specific to Zato's codebase and reports regarding a successful
installation on other systems are :doc:`highly encouraged <../../project/get-involved>`.

Future Zato versions will most certainly support additional platforms and systems.

Steps
-----

* Prepare a system with at least 300 MB of disk space 
* Ensure you have root/sudo permissions on that system
* Make sure the system will let the installer establish outgoing connections to the Internet,
  this is needed in order to download all the dependencies required
* Create an empty directory (DIR)
* Download 
  `the installation package <https://zato.io/download/1.0>`_
  into DIR, e.g.:

  .. parsed-literal::
      
    DIR$ wget -c https://zato.io/download/zato-1.0.tar.bz2 .
  
* Decompress the package, e.g.:

  .. parsed-literal::
  
    DIR$ tar -xjf zato-|version|.tar.bz2
    
* Run the installer 

  .. parsed-literal::
  
    DIR$ ./install.sh

  There will be a lot of output written out to stdout and on a successful completion
  you will see OK printed out, e.g.
  
  .. parsed-literal::
  
    DIR$ ./install.sh 
    [sudo] password for user: 
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree
    
    ..
    .. (snipped output)
    ..
    
    patch: in DIR/code/eggs/ ..
    patch: processing 1/1:	 DIR/code/eggs/ ..
    patch: successfully patched DIR/code/eggs/ ..

    OK
    DIR$

  Depending on how fast the system is and on the quality of the
  Internet connectivity, it will take at least several minutes for the installer
  to complete so in that time, why don't you have a look at 
  :doc:`the tutorial <../../tutorial/01>`,
  :doc:`Zato's <../../intro/overview-high-level>`
  :doc:`overview <../../intro/overview-tech>`, 
  :doc:`its architecture <../../architecture/overview>`,
  :doc:`the web-admin <../../web-admin/intro>`, 
  :doc:`programming documentation<../../progguide/overview>`
  and
  :doc:`several  <../../admin/cli/index>`
  :doc:`of  <../../admin/guide/install-config/overview>`
  :doc:`the  <../../admin/guide/ha>`
  :doc:`admin  <../../admin/guide/capacity>`
  :doc:`guides <../../admin/guide/installing-services>`
  or something else in 
  :doc:`the docs <../../index>`?

  
* Add DIR/bin to $PATH so that the zato command is available in the shell, e.g.

  .. parsed-literal::
  
    DIR$ echo export 'PATH=$PATH:'$(pwd)/bin >> ~/.bashrc
    DIR$ source ~/.bashrc
    
* Confirm the zato command can be executed

  .. parsed-literal::
  
    DIR$ zato --version
    Zato |version|
    DIR$
  
* That's all, Zato has been successfully installed in the system. 
  You can now visit :doc:`the main documentation index <../../index>` and have 
  fun with the next generation ESB and application server!
