Guaranteed delivery
===================

Guaranteed delivery allows one to deal with communication issues that are of *transient*
nature.

It is meant to aid in cases where temporary lack of access to certain resources
can be tolerated and the required action on Zato's part is to store data persistently and 
repeat invocations periodically for a specified time, giving up eventually if the resource
to be accessed is still not available after a configured number of attempts.

The chapter presents the feature, lists requirements on user's part
and goes through a life-cycle each guaranteed delivery is subject to along with an explanation
what is to be expected with regards to where and how data is stored on each stage.

When to use guaranteed delivery and when not to
-----------------------------------------------

Making use of the feature implies certain overhead which may be non-negligible. Background checks
are started, more data is stored in ODB and all that represents additional costs that may influence
also these services that don't require guaranteed delivery themselves.

Typically, you won't use it for:

* Get/read operations - returning any objects can be almost always repeated by clients
* Updates that are soon repeated anyway - if there's a stream of information and each 10 minutes
  the same set of data is repeated till midnight, you don't need to guarantee its delivery
  as it will be repeated soon
* Anything that is easily repeated on client side

When to usually use it:

* If requests can't be conveniently repeated and transient errors are to be expected

Note that each guaranteed delivery effort ultimately ends in one of well-defined states.
This may mean Zato's retrying the same request for hours or days, however it's configured,
but still the feature is not meant to deal with permanent issues that need compensating
actions. In that case, higher-level processes outside of Zato's guaranteed delivery should be introduced.

Each delivery always deal with one source and one target. There's no notion of group deliveries
confirmed as a whole although a target may always initiate communication with multiple
recipients each within its own confirmed delivery task.

Delivery mechanism
------------------

Actors involved are:

* :doc:`SQL ODB<./sql-odb>` - where data is kept
* Delivery store - Zato's central code to coordinate delivery effort
* Scheduler jobs - run periodically to re-submit delivery tasks that were stopped unexpectedly
* Startup services - run when a server is starting up, also resubmit interrupted tasks 

* Source - the end initiating a delivery

  * A service deployed in Zato
  * An HTTP client
  * AMQP queue
  * WebSphere MQ queue
  * ZeroMQ socket

* Target - the delivery's recipient, this is one of

  * A service deployed in Zato
  * An HTTP resource
  * An FTP server
  * AMQP exchange
  * WebSphere MQ queue
  * ZeroMQ socket
